# Attendance System
This is a react based attendance system for my church

### Stack
React frontend with a firebase realtime Database as the backend

### What is going on?
The main page is dynamically filtering the dates and participants(through class type and search filter) to display the attendance and lets the user enter the data.  

I have a dashboard that I where I can add/update/delete users and that will generate a report of everyones attendance.
